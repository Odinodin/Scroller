Sinescroller:

I was remembering the old Amiga-intros and thought it would be neat if I could make one of my own.
The real problem here was figuring out how to make the sine-wave (obviously:) but it turned out
to be a cakewalk. It boils down to tinkering with the sine-parameters described in any calculus
textbook and the Math.sin() java method.
